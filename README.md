This repository houses the qmd that calculates all absolute abundances for all habitat types given available data, and export the results as a CSV.

Other repositories within this organization contain calculations of absolute abundance. However, this repository houses the finalized calculations, including error checks. The results of the absolute abundance calculations are exported as a csv at the end of the qmd - and this csv is included within the repository as well. 

These calculations are for depth, substrate, and biota from PMEP sources (see main Github organization for full description of data sources). Absolute abundance calculations for estuarine and deep sea biota are housed within the Biota repository within this organization.
